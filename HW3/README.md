# Working Group:
### 1-Umer Zubair
### 2-Abdul Rehman
### 3-Ek Narayan Paudel

## Working on Z test:

Everyone in the group did this test individually as most of the work was already done in the class. After the class all of us discussed the Z test and how it works to reach at the conclusion.


## Working on KS test:

### Ek Narayan Paudel: 
Contributed in extracting the data from the earthquake website and arranging the data in a readable form. Also made some plots and did the labelling. Some of the ploting functions were not running on other group members machines (maybe due to the fact that some libraries are missing) so the final notebook was run on Ek's machine to finalize it before submitting. 

### Umer Zubair: 
Contributed in working with the pandas data frames (df), modifying the dfs and doing calculations with df. Since he is most experienced in working with data frames. Also worked together with others in the group on the data analysis portion. 

### Abdul Rehman: 
Contributed in cleaning and simplifying the code i.e writing the comments in the functions to make it easily understandable to others. wrote different functions so that we dont have to rewrite the piece of code again and again.
